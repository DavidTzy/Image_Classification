This is an image classification work practice with use of Xception, InceptionV3 and Resnet50.
The dataset comes from Cdiscount Kaggle competition. 
The chanllenges of this project firstly is the huge volume, namely more than 70GB data with 14 million images, this can be drawn using generator to train the DNN model and the use of Multi-GPU(if you have, keras support it),but still it takes days or weeks.
Other chanllenges besides data volume, like how to do data augmentation for rare cases, like how to predict one outcome given several pics etc. are also very interesting stuff to think.
